        <p>Hi, my name is Dakota Denison. Welcome to my website!</p>
        <p>I currently work at <a href="https://www.mdrc.org/">mdrc</a>, a social policy research firm, as a statistical
            programmer.
            I currently work on several education policy programs, including MTSSB,
            UPK, U2R, and LAD. Generally, my responsibilities include data processing, modeling, and presenting results.
            In the past, I have worked on and studied economics and math at the University of Michigan.</p>
        <p>In my spare time, I enjoy working at the intersection of data science and software engineering.
