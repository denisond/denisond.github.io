    <p>Hi, my name is Dakota Denison. Welcome to my website!</p>
    <p>I currently work at <a href="https://www.mdrc.org/">mdrc</a>, a social policy research firm, as a statistical programmer. 
        I currently work on several education policy programs, including MTSSB,
        UPK, U2R, and LAD. Generally, my responsibilities include data processing, modeling, and presenting results. 
        In the past, I have worked on and studied economics and math at the University of Michigan.</p>

        Past projects include data science competitions,
